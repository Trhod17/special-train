        <h2>About Us & What We do</h2>
        
        <p>Aussie Kidz Charity assists the families of children under the age of 18 years old that
        are diagnosed with a disability.</p>
        
        <p>After years of supporting various well known kids charities,
        Aussie Kidz Charity was started in early 2000 by a group of individuals disheartened
        by watching an increasing percentage of donations being used to cover overheads instead
        of going to the ones who need it most, the Kids.</p>
        <p>With Aussie Kidz Charity, 100% of the donations received are used for the children,
        with the running costs and overheads kept to an absolute minimum and looked after 
        by the Directors and friends.</p>
        <p>Since starting, we have raised over $750,000 and have
        provided over 150 grants covering mobility aids, walking frames, specialised clothing
        and other assistance to these very special kids.</p>
        <p>We are focussing on gaining support and
        donations through the generosity of Directors, individuals, corporations, estate trusts
        and through various yearly fund raising activities.</p>
        
        <p>These includes the Mercedes Benz Polo Championships held each September and a 
        Brisbane Businessmanâ€™s lunch held each November.
        Aussie Kidz Charity has received the Australian Taxation Office endorsement in May
        2001 to allow donations over $2 to be tax deductible.
